                            <ul>
                                <li class="">the time you were on a plane and wrote a business plan for our first collaboration. then your pen exploded.</li>
                                <li class="">the time you patiently tried to teach me about tennis scoring while we played ping-pong. i still don't get it, but i had fun. and that's what matters.</li>
                                <li class="">i guess you had shannon "hold your watch" at some point in ptown so you could cartwheel down the street. awesome.</li>
                                <li class="">that time in st. john when you came bounding up to me with a plan to become ‘besties 4 life’ just because nobody thought we were capable of it.</li>
                                <li class="">when we went to the arcade in salem and you bought roughly $10,000 in tokens. best day ever.</li>
                                <li class="">your crazy determination to help me find an interview outfit when i was stressing out about it.
                                </li>
                                <li class="">every time you lose your mind about fanduel. so funny.</li>
                                <li class="">benedryl is your gateway drug.</li>
                                <li class="">you jumped in a frozen lake to ‘inspire’ people… seriously, who does that?</li>
                                <li>you take down dirty martinis like a champ.</li>
                                <li class="">the time i asked you not to say anything negative about the cats. which you subsequently turned into an opportunity to use every word in the english language containing the phrase "cat" (clarifiCATion, colloCATing, compliCATed, CATch, CATastrophic, CATalyst...).</li>
                                <li class="">the first time i met you at Stella on my 30th birthday. you bounced in, paid the tab and escaped from the situation as quickly as possible.</li>
                                <li class="">the time you bought us NES classics. i hear you dropped your purse and sprinted to best buy.</li>
                                <li class="">whenever you seamlessly drop the phrase “order of solve” into everyday conversation. nerd.</li>
                                <li class="">that time you let your boss stick her finger up your nose for a picture. major dedication.</li>
                                <li class="">‘love shove’. enough said.</li>
                                <li class="">when you offered to help me move because you knew i would never ask for help. it still counts even though you retracted the offer if it means a road trip to portland...</li>
                                <li class="">when you stood up to the that ridiculously grumpy woman at the pied. it didn't help. and probably made things worse. i appreciated the effort anyway.</li>
